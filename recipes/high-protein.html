    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>We love this vegetarian dish; it's simple, healthy, and super easy to make. You could easily add chicken if you're looking for a more complete meal.</p>
   
   
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces enriched thin spaghetti (such as Ronzoni® Smart Taste®)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pine nuts</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmasan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 small shallots, julienned</li>
        <li>8 cherry tomatoes, halved, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) package fresh Spinach</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmasan cheese</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons grated Parmasan cheese</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the thin spaghetti, 
            bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. 
            Drain and set aside, reserving 1/4 cup pasta water.</li>        
        <li>While pasta is cooking, place pine nuts in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring 
            frequently, until golden-brown, about 3 minutes. Remove nuts to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil to the skillet and increase heat to medium. 
            Add garlic, shallots, cherry tomatoes, and lemon zest; 
            cook and stir until shallots have softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. 
            Add spinach, lemon juice, toasted pine nuts, salt, and pepper; cook until spinach has wilted, 
            1 to 2 minutes. Add drained pasta, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and reserved pasta water; mix to 
            combine. Serve with remaining Parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
     
    </ol>
